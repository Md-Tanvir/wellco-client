    "text": "A course description can be defined succinctly as all the relevant details of your course. This is a simplistic description and rather open-ended, but there is a reason for that. There are many types of online courses that target a variety of levels of competence and types of customers/employees. For example, a general interest course on how to knit a jumper will probably not have the same course description format, tone, and writing style as an online degree program from a recognized institution of higher education, but they will have similar types of information. So, it will be helpful to break down the course description into specific areas of content – some of these would be considered ‘mandatory,’ while others can be included or left out as needed.For example, if you’re going to place your course on a course selling platform like iSpring Market to sell it online, you will be asked to add a course topic, course format, an author’s bio, and some other information to ‘build out’ your course description."
